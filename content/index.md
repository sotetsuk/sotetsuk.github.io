**Sotetsu Koyamada**, Ph.D., is a researcher and engineer interested in reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent systems, and game AI. 
I have been involved in the following projects:
<!--- He obtained his Ph.D. from Kyoto University in Nov. 2024. --->

* Led the [**Japanese translation**](https://www.kyoritsu-pub.co.jp/book/b10003874.html) of the theoretical [**RL textbook by C. Szepesvári**](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/rlbook.html).
* [**Suphx**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/suphx-mastering-mahjong-with-deep-reinforcement-learning/): Microsoft’s Mahjong AI, which achieved an estimated rating higher than 99.99% of human players on an online Mahjong platform.
* [**Pgx**](https://github.com/sotetsuk/pgx): A scalable, ultra-fast suite of game simulators running on GPUs, written in JAX.
* [**Mjx**](https://github.com/mjx-project/mjx): A high-speed Mahjong simulator written in C++/Python.
* Developed [**Bridge AI**](https://doi.org/10.1109/CoG60054.2024.10645547) with state-of-the-art performance in the bidding benchmark against WBridge5.
